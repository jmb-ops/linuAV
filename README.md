## how it works: 

linuAV generates a list of ALL executables found in
any folder scanned and outputs it in a text file we call baseline
in cwd. Later, when you feel you have been comprimised or infected, 
use linuAV to create another file. The 'scan' feature will show you 
if any new malicous executables latched on to your system.

if you remain uninfected this is what you should see.
